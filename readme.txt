Core Business Questions
What percentage of students are successfully placed?

How does placement performance vary by specialization?

Does prior work experience improve placement probability and salary?

How strongly do academic scores influence employability?

Are there identifiable student profiles with higher placement risk?

Which education paths deliver the highest return on investment (ROI)?


Key Insights
